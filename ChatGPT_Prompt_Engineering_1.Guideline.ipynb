    "- Write clear and specific instructions\n",
    "    - **Note: *clear $\\ne$ short*:** Sometimes longer prompts can provide better clarity and contexts for the model\n",
    "    - **Tactic 1**: use *delimiters*\n",
    "        - What are *delimiters*:\n",
    "            - triple quotes \"\"\"\n",
    "            - triple backticks ```\n",
    "            - triple dashes ---\n",
    "            - angle brackets <>\n",
    "            - XML tags: \\<tag\\> \\</tag\\>\n",
    "        - Advantage:\n",
    "            - Can avoid *prompt injection* (the user's instruction confuses the model from generating what you designed as is)\n",
    "    - **Tactic 2**: ask for *structured output*\n",
    "        - What are *structured output*\n",
    "            - HTML\n",
    "            - JSON\n",
    "    - **Tactic 3**: check wheather conditions are satisfied, and provide a return function if not satisfied\n",
    "    - **Tactic 4**: \"Few shot\" prompting\n",
    "        - Provide successful examples of completing tasks, then ask model to perform the task\n",
    "- Give the model time to think\n",
    "    - **Note**: \n",
    "        - If a model is making reasoning errors by rushing to an incorrect conclusion, you should try reframing the query to request a chain of questions before the final answer\n",
    "        - If you give a model a task that is too complex to finish in a short time or small number of words, it may make an assumption which is likely incorrect\n",
    "    - **Tactic 1**: Specify the steps required to complete a task\n",
    "        - Step 1\n",
    "        - Step 2\n",
    "        - Step 3\n",
    "        - ...\n",
    "        - Step N\n",
